# Testing compression of bevy scenes with [zstd](https://github.com/facebook/zstd) dictionary.

This work pretty well. With the dictionary on average scene files are `4.284286%` of the raw size.

These scene files are `RON` text files so the high compressability isn't surprising.

Scene files are from my personal project.
